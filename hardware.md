You need to connect your guitar to your phone if you want to use the headphone amp. 

To do this requires:

1 x 3.5mm male to 6.35mm male audio cable
1 x 3.5mm TRRS male to dual 3.5mm female adapter

Then:

- Plug the audio cable into your guitar and the adapter.
- Plug your headphones into the adapter.
- Plug the adapter into your phone.
- Done! You can now access the headphone amp.

Note: For users that don't have a headphone port on their phone you will need to 
use a Lightning to 3.5mm female adapter in addition to the other items.
